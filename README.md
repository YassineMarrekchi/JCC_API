## Overview of the project 

Cinema is an integral part of cultural expression, offering a window into diverse human
experiences. The Carthage Film Festival (JCC) celebrates this through the art of film, offering
an opportunity to explore rich cultural narratives and immersive experiences. JeyCC is a web
service designed to enhance the JCC experience by providing festival attendees with a special
emphasis on cinema accessibility.
Key features include the ability to purchase festival tickets, reserve seats in cinemas for
specific movies, and secure transportation in advance, through carpool convoys.
In addition, JeyCC allows users to pre-order a selection of traditional Tunisian snacks,
offering a taste of the local culture and ensuring a seamless and immersive festival experience
from start to finish. It also provides organizations with the option to rent private buses or the
Cinemobile for employees, students, or staff, further enhancing accessibility and encouraging
participation.
By providing such flexibility, JeyCC ensures that the Carthage Film Festival becomes more
inclusive, making the cultural and cinematic experience available to a broader audience. This
comprehensive approach enhances the festivalâ€™s accessibility and overall enjoyment, allowing
people to connect with the event regardless of their location or logistical constraints.
